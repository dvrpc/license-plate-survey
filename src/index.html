                    This web map shows trip origins for transit users that drive to and park motor vehicles at train stations or park-and-ride lots in the Delaware Valley Region. This map only includes train stations and park-and-rides that have publicly accessible parking and have been surveyed by DVRPC. Each station’s data is based on fieldwork completed in one day, typically in fall or spring between the hours of 9 AM and 4 PM.
                </p>

                    After receiving the anonymous, geocoded records from federal agencies, DVRPC converted the information into a GIS format in order to be used internally and in this application. To ensure privacy of the cars that were surveyed, we decided to aggregate the points to a standard geography in order to visualize trends of how people are using public transportation as part of their commute. In this case, the standard geography we decided on were 1/2 square mile hexagons that are large enough to anonymize the points within them, but also small enough to effectively display the trends in the data.

                <h2>Directions</h2>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Using the Search Stations drop down, choose a station from the list.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Next, chose a data collection year and press search.
                    </li>
                        
                    <li>
                        Once the data is displayed users can click on the box titled “legend” in the top left corner of the map to open a drop down. The drop down provides information including the station’s operator, the name and type of transit line, the total number of car commuters surveyed, and the values associated with each tile color. Users can zoom in or out using the scroll wheel on the mouse or by double clicking on a location.
                    </li>
                </ol>
